This repository includes the data and code needed to reproduce the results reported in __Sea snot, see ya later: An assessment of heat and freshwater for controlling the invasive, biofouling tunicate, *Didemnum vexillum*__.  A .rmd and pdf of the code can be found in the Code folder.  The csv of the data as well as an excel sheet containing both the raw data and the metadata are found in the Data folder.  The actual paper can be found within the Paper folder.  The two images present in this README are found in the Images folder.  Photos of the samples can be found on a USB in the Bamfield Marine Science Center, Bamfield BC, Canada and can be made available by contacting the University Programs Coordinator.
